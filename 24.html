It is known as format string and this informs the scanf() function, what type of input to expect and in printf() it is used to give a heads up to the compiler, what type of output to expect. example
&nbsp %d	use = Scan or print an integer as signed decimal number<br>
&nbsp%f	use = Scan or print a floating point number<br>
&nbsp%c	use = To scan or print a character<br>
&nbsp%s	use = To scan or print a character string. The scanning ends at whitespace.

<b>getchar()/putchar()</b> = putchar() function is a file handling function in C programming language which is used to write a character on standard output/screen. getchar() function is used to get/read a character from keyboard input.getchar is a function in C programming language that reads a single character from the standard input stream stdin, regardless of what it is, and returns it to the program. It is specified in ANSI-C and is the most basic input function in C. It is included in the stdio. h header file.Description. The C library function int putchar(int char) writes a character (an unsigned char) specified by the argument char to stdout.<br><br>
<b>gets()/puts() </b> = C program gets() and puts() function. Both the functions are used to in the input and output operation of the Strings. The gets() functions are used to read string input from the keyboard and puts() function displays it. These functions are declared in the stdio. h header fileThe puts() function in C/C++ is used to write a line or string to the output( stdout ) stream. It prints the passed string with a newline and returns an integer value. The return value depends on the success of the writing procedure. The C library function char *gets(char *str) reads a line from stdin and stores it into the string pointed to by str. It stops when either the newline character is read or when the end-of-file is reached, whichever comes first.
