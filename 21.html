It is machine-independent, structured programming language which is used extensively in various applications.

C was the basic language to write everything from operating systems (Windows and many others) to complex programs like the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter and more.

It is said that 'C' is a god's programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If you know 'C,' you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of 'C'.</font><br>

According to the Bell Labs paper The Development of the C Language by Dennis Ritchie, â€œThe C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located in the U.S.A.</font><br>
